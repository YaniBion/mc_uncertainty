Probabilistic treatment of the uncertainty from the finite size of weighted Monte Carlo data

This repository implements a collection of functions defined in https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01293, in particular the functions
shown in the summary table. Jupyter notebooks for the Poisson-like and multinomial-like likelihoods demonstrate the usage.
The scripts include some functions which implement different ways to calculate the fourth Lauricella function FD.
The alternative method from https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0735 is also included.
